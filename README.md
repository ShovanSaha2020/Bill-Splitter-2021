# Bill-Splitter-2021
## JetBrains Academy Project | Level :  Medium

### About
Everyone likes eating out with friends. The more friends, the better, but the bill time is always a bummer, to say the least. Why not develop a tool to keep the fun alive and make sure that everyone pays an equal amount. This program can split the bills among friends. In addition, if you want, it can also pick a lucky winner who don't have to share the bills.

### Example Outputs:
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.
